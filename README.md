**Step 1: Generate Data**

Created synthetic data for business process analysis across industries.

Key variables include cost per transaction, processing time, error rate, automation level, and customer satisfaction.

**Step 2: Identify Process Inefficiencies using Clustering**

Standardized data for proper clustering.

Applied K-Means Clustering to segment business processes.

Helps identify high-cost or inefficient processes.

**Step 3: Detect Anomalous Business Processes**

Used Isolation Forest to find anomalies in high-cost/delay processes.

Identifies outliers with inefficiencies needing urgent optimization.

**Step 4: Predict Business Efficiency Improvement**

Built a Linear Regression Model to predict business process satisfaction.

Helps estimate the impact of automation and process improvements.
